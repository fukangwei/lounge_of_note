### Detailed Description

&emsp;&emsp;The `QPoint` class defines a point in the plane using integer precision.
&emsp;&emsp;A point is specified by a `x` coordinate and an `y` coordinate which can be accessed using the `x()` and `y()` functions. The `isNull()` function returns `true` if both `x` and `y` are set to `0`. The coordinates can be set (or altered) using the `setX()` and `setY()` functions, or alternatively the `rx()` and `ry()` functions which return references to the coordinates (allowing direct manipulation).
&emsp;&emsp;Given a point `p`, the following statements are all equivalent:

``` cpp
QPoint p;

p.setX(p.x() + 1);
p += QPoint(1, 0);
p.rx()++;
```

&emsp;&emsp;A `QPoint` object can also be used as a vector: Addition and subtraction are defined as for vectors (each component is added separately). A `QPoint` object can also be divided or multiplied by an `int` or a `qreal`.
&emsp;&emsp;In addition, the `QPoint` class provides the `manhattanLength()` function which gives an inexpensive approximation of the length of the `QPoint` object interpreted as a vector. Finally, `QPoint` objects can be streamed as well as compared.

### Member Function Documentation

- `QPoint::QPoint()`: Constructs a null point, i.e. with coordinates `(0, 0)`.
- `QPoint::QPoint(int x, int y)`: Constructs a point with the given coordinates `(x, y)`.
- `bool QPoint::isNull() const`: Returns `true` if both the `x` and `y` coordinates are set to `0`, otherwise returns `false`.
- `int QPoint::manhattanLength() const`: Returns the sum of the absolute values of `x()` and `y()`, traditionally known as the `Manhattan length` of the vector from the origin to the point.

``` cpp
QPoint oldPosition;

MyWidget::mouseMoveEvent ( QMouseEvent *event ) {
    QPoint point = event->pos() - oldPosition;

    if ( point.manhattanLength() > 3 )
        // the mouse has moved more than 3 pixels since the oldPosition
}
```

This is a useful, and quick to calculate, approximation to the true length:

``` cpp
double trueLength = sqrt ( pow ( x(), 2 ) + pow ( y(), 2 ) );
```

The tradition of `Manhattan length` arises because such distances apply to travelers who can only travel on a rectangular grid, like the streets of `Manhattan`.

- `int & QPoint::rx()`: Returns a reference to the `x` coordinate of this point. Using a reference makes it possible to directly manipulate `x`.

``` cpp
QPoint p ( 1, 2 );
p.rx()--; /* p becomes (0, 2) */
```

- `int & QPoint::ry()`: Returns a reference to the `y` coordinate of this point. Using a reference makes it possible to directly manipulate `y`.

``` cpp
QPoint p ( 1, 2 );
p.ry()++; /* p becomes (1, 3) */
```

- `void QPoint::setX(int x)`: Sets the `x` coordinate of this point to the given `x` coordinate.
- `void QPoint::setY(int y)`: Sets the `y` coordinate of this point to the given `y` coordinate.
- `int QPoint::x() const`: Returns the `x` coordinate of this point.
- `int QPoint::y() const`: Returns the `y` coordinate of this point.
- `QPoint & QPoint::operator*=(float factor)`: Multiplies this point's coordinates by the given `factor`, and returns a reference to this point. Note that the result is rounded to the nearest integer as points are held as integers. Use `QPointF` for floating point accuracy.
- `QPoint & QPoint::operator*=(double factor)`: Multiplies this point's coordinates by the given `factor`, and returns a reference to this point.

``` cpp
QPoint p ( -1, 4 );
p *= 2.5; /* p becomes (-3, 10) */
```

Note that the result is rounded to the nearest integer as points are held as integers. Use `QPointF` for floating point accuracy.

- `QPoint & QPoint::operator*=(int factor)`: Multiplies this point's coordinates by the given `factor`, and returns a reference to this point.
- `QPoint & QPoint::operator+=(const QPoint & point)`: Adds the given `point` to this `point` and returns a reference to this `point`.

``` cpp
QPoint p ( 3, 7 );
QPoint q ( -1, 4 );
p += q; /* p becomes (2, 11) */
```

- `QPoint & QPoint::operator-=(const QPoint & point)`: Subtracts the given `point` from this `point` and returns a reference to this `point`.

``` cpp
QPoint p ( 3, 7 );
QPoint q ( -1, 4 );
p -= q; /* p becomes (4, 3) */
```

- `QPoint & QPoint::operator/=(qreal divisor)`: This is an overloaded function. Divides both `x` and `y` by the given `divisor`, and returns a reference to this point.

``` cpp
QPoint p ( -3, 10 );
p /= 2.5; /* p becomes (-1, 4) */
```

Note that the result is rounded to the nearest integer as points are held as integers. Use `QPointF` for floating point accuracy.
